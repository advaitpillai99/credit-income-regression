# Predicting Income Using Linear Regression

## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary
Built simple and multiple linear regression models to predict a personâ€™s income using demographic variables from a credit dataset. Applied data partitioning, feature selection (backward elimination), and evaluated model performance.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Name:** CreditCard.csv (synthetic credit dataset)
- **Target:** Income
- **Features:** Dependents, Education, Age, Credit Score, etc.

## ðŸ§  Skills Demonstrated
- EDA & Data Partitioning
- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Residual & Metric Analysis (SST, SSR, F-statistic)
- Model Validation & Overfitting Consideration

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `credit_income_model.ipynb`: Full notebook with code, analysis, and results
